Regular training is also a tool for retention and empowering upward economic mobility. How do you plan to encourage economic development? \u201cTo lower the cost and clean the air, upgrading the grid will get us there.\u201d Our community has needlessly suffered for the last decade because the people we elect are managers and not leaders. Demonstrated clearly by their unwillingness to challenge how we make, distribute, store, and use energy. Admittedly in the 90\u2019s green investments where long term. As the new millennium began however, this trend began to shift where conservation became a critical means of avoided cost savings. Now, again this market has shifted, and social impact investors are seeing 15-30% returns after only five years. Being \u201cgreen\u201d is now the fastest way to grow a healthy financial portfolio for people and the Borough alike. 20 years ago, centralized generation and distribution was best practices and now it\u2019s a costly impediment to economic growth. Decentralized generation, as a community initiative, is affordable, reliable, and will avoid costly delays. Contact reporter Jack Barnwell at 907-459-7587 or jbarnwell@newsminer.com.

Updated: September 30, 2024 @ 5:50 am Grier Hopkins Grier Hopkins is running for the Fairbanks North Star Borough mayor\u2019s seat. Hopkins was born and raised in Fairbanks. He was an Alaska House Representative for District 4 from 2018 to 2022, with a strong focus on education and labor. He has worked as a private-sector labor representative, negotiator and organizer for the employees of the Fairbanks North Star Borough School District. Education funding has been a constant discussion for the past few years. How do you think the borough should address it at the local level? As new families look where to live, our schools are the first thing many will look at to see if we are a good place to move. The first thing we need to do is to go to the state capitol and have the legislature permanently increase funding for schools. This will keep taxes down and improve local schools of all kinds \u2014 correspondence, charter and neighborhood schools. Here locally, to sustainably bring new funding to our school district, we must build our economy with new construction and good jobs. This will build our revenue base keeping tax cap intact, and help fund our schools. I\u2019m a product of our local public schools, and I want them to be as great for my daughter as they were for me and my wife. Our schools will be my priority, because they are the foundation of any growing and thriving community. Outside of education, what are the most pressing concerns the borough should focus on? I care deeply about the success of our entire community, and I am running to put it on the path to a bright future, but we can\u2019t do that with declining population. Turning that decline around, must be the priority of the next mayor. I see that happening through a strong economy\u2013 new construction, tearing down abandoned buildings, and creating new jobs. Then improving our schools and access to child care, so new families see a place they want to raise their children. Then improving our quality of life with new access to the great outdoors, parks and rec, and places for families to play. We can accomplish those three things together, and we will create a community that will be the envy of Alaska. The borough and city of Fairbanks have a complicated relationship and are often at odds on certain topics (downtown plan and joint economic development agreements). How do you think the borough better facilitate partnerships with North Pole and Fairbanks? One of the first thing I\u2019ll do is to begin to rebuild those bridges with North Pole and Fairbanks. We can work on the big issues, and overcome obstacles together if we\u2019re not fighting over the smaller things. The Borough and the city me be at the"
